# React Frontend (Airline Reservation)

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React app with Tailwind for styles.

Quick start:
- cd frontend/react-app
- npm install
- npm run dev

Notes:
- Dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000` as configured in `vite.config.mjs`.
- Tailwind is included via PostCSS; if the `postinstall` step runs, it will build the CSS into `dist/` for production.
