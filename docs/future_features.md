# Future Features & Roadmap

This file lists prioritized, short-term and longer-term improvements (concise descriptions only).

High priority
- Payment integration (Stripe/PayPal) — Secure payments and webhooks for booking lifecycle.
- Seat map & selection — Interactive seat assignment with availability and hold windows.
- Complete auth & roles — Solidify login, registration, tokens, and admin role checks.

Medium priority
- Email/SMS notifications — Booking confirmations, reminders, and alerts.
- Booking hold & timeouts — Temporary seat holds to prevent race conditions during checkout.
- Improved tests & CI — Add integration tests and a CI pipeline to run them.

Lower priority / Nice to have
- Dynamic pricing / ML — Price optimization using historical demand and load factors.
- Reporting & dashboards — Admin dashboards for bookings, revenue, and KPIs.
- Multi-currency & tax support — Expand payments to support currencies and regional tax rules.

Notes
Each item can be broken down into implementation tasks (API endpoints, data model changes, frontend UX). Tell me which item you want prioritized and I can create a scoped task list and initial implementation.
